## Game Concept

This is a narrative-driven progression game where real-life habits directly affect the in-game world. Players log daily behavior (porn usage, screen time, productivity), and the game responds with rewards or penalties.

### Core Features

1. **Daily Habit Log:**
   - Did you watch porn today? (Yes/No)
   - How many minutes did you spend on YouTube or short-form content?
   - What productive task did you complete today? (Text input)

2. **Reward System:**
   - No porn: +50 XP
   - Screen time ≤ 120 minutes: +30 XP
   - Productive task completed: +40 XP
   - Completing all three gives a bonus reward
   - Streaks unlock new levels, visuals, and story elements

3. **Punishment System (Non-shaming):**
   - Porn usage reduces XP and darkens the game world
   - Excessive screen time increases difficulty
   - No productivity spawns obstacles
   - No permanent failure or game over

4. **Visual Feedback:**
   - Character evolution
   - World map that improves or decays
   - XP bars, streak counters, animations

5. **Pages:**
   - Dashboard (stats, character, world state)
   - Daily Log Page
   - Challenges Page (new)
   - History Page (new)
   - Progress & Analytics
   - Game World / Map
   - Settings
